# 2022+ Subaru WRX Dynamic LED Reflector Platform

![Project Header](placeholder.jpg)

A full-stack hardware and software solution to replace static OEM rear reflectors with addressable, reactive LED modules. This project features a modular PCB designed for the VB chassis but adaptable to any 12V automotive lighting application.

## 🚀 Technical Overview
- **Mechanical:** Custom 3D-printed housings (Fusion 360) designed for OEM fitment.
- **Electrical:** Dual-layer custom PCB (KiCad) with 12V->5V buck regulation and signal filtering.
- **Software:** C++ Firmware (Arduino) utilizing **FastLED** for sequential animations and interrupt-driven brake logic.

## 🛠️ Hardware Stack
- **MCU:** ESP-32-S3-WROOM
- **LEDs:** WS2812B Addressable Strips
- **Design Tools:** KiCad 9.0, Autodesk Fusion 360, Adobe Lightroom (Documentation)
- **3D Printer:** Bambu Labs P1S, PLA & PETG
